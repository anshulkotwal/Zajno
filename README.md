    npm start
    ```

## ⚙️ How It Works
- **Three.js** creates a dynamic 3D scene with a camera, lighting, and custom shaders for unique visual effects.
- Custom **vertex** and **fragment shaders** (written in GLSL) allow real-time texture manipulations and beautiful hover effects on images.
- **Locomotive Scroll** provides smooth scrolling throughout the page for an immersive experience.
- **GSAP** animates hover interactions and mouse movements with smooth transitions.
- The 3D scene is rendered to a canvas, and elements adjust dynamically on window resize.

### 🔑 Key Components:
- **Three.js Scene**: The heart of the project, handling 3D rendering and animations.
- **GLSL Shaders**: Stunning visual effects for textures and mouse interactions.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Hover over images to trigger real-time animations.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented using **Locomotive Scroll** for seamless page navigation.
